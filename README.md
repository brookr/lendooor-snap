# Proof of Concept Monorepo

This repository demonstrates how to integrate various Consensys products,
using TypeScript. For detailed
instructions, see [the MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html#serving-a-snap-to-your-local-environment).

MetaMask Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely expand the capabilities
of MetaMask. A _snap_ is a program that we run in an isolated environment that
can customize the wallet experience.

## Testing and Linting

Run `yarn test` to run the tests once.

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter, or run `yarn lint:fix` to run the linter and
fix any automatically fixable issues.

## Using NPM packages with scripts

Scripts are disabled by default for security reasons. If you need to use NPM
packages with scripts, you can run `yarn allow-scripts auto`, and enable the
script in the `lavamoat.allowScripts` section of `package.json`.

See the documentation for [@lavamoat/allow-scripts](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/tree/main/packages/allow-scripts)
for more information.
